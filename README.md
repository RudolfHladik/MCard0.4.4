# SWTOR Utilities Setup
test project

This app helps SWTOR players to save their characters and theirs utilities setup to this mobile app, 
so you dont have to remember all those diffrent setups you use for PvE or PvP.

Although the app is still in development, the main function is already available.

After you login anonymously(no other option is available yet) you can create your own characters and save their utilities setups
and than you will always find them in list of Cards on main screen.
Mind that, design of this app is only functional not polished.

Please be patient, features will be coming Soonâ„¢
